# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System

The Project is about a Real-Time Human-Computer Interaction System based on hand
gesture. The whole system consists of three components: Hand Detection, Gesture
Recognition and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) based on recognition and it realizes
the robust control of mouse and key-board events with a higher accuracy of gesture
recognition. 

OpenCVis used to recognize gestures and makes it attainable to identify relatively complex gestures using only one cheap monocular camera. The developed system is highly extendable and can be used in human-robotic or other human-machine interaction scenarios with more complex command formats rather than just mouse and keyboard events.
